# First Person Shooter Game – Unity

This is a 3D first-person shooter game built in Unity where the player navigates a mountainous and sci-fi facility-based environment. The goal is to survive enemy attacks and fight through a patrolling bot army using two different weapons.

## 🎮 Gameplay Features

- 🌄 The game starts in an open terrain and leads into a closed facility.
- 🔫 The player can switch between two weapons: a pistol (slow and precise) and a rifle (fast and automatic).
- ❤️ A health bar is shown on screen and updates in real time.
- 🤖 Enemies patrol outside the facility. If they see the player, they chase and shoot. If they hear the player but don’t see them, they rotate in place to search before resuming patrol.
- 💥 Player can shoot enemies. After 3 hits, the enemy is destroyed.
- 🎵 Background music plays in the main menu and sound effects are included for walking.
- 💀 A Game Over screen appears when the player dies with an option to return to the main menu.
